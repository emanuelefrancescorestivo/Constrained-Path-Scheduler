# Decisions

Architecture and product decisions, newest last, each with what was chosen, what
was rejected and why. D1 to D7 (the hosted app's stack, storage, hosting, no
passwords, personal data, the name) are in `docs/ROADMAP.md`. A decision is
changed by a new entry that says which one it replaces, not by editing an old one.

The owner's answers of 2026-10-08, which D8 to D15 build on: **France first, in
French and English; a free pilot, then a free core with a paid tier; private,
opt-in study buddies; AI features on a small monthly budget paid with the owner's
API key.** `docs/MARKET.md` is the analysis behind the questions, `docs/STRATEGY.md`
the product they lead to, `docs/DESIGN.md` the screens.

## D8. Progress is derived from the plan, never counted separately

**Chosen.** Streaks, the week's ring, the calendar of days studied and the
milestones are computed when a page is drawn, from three things the subscription
already holds: the plan's past sessions (`PlanReport.history`, kept for the whole
semester), what the student reported (`Subscription.outcomes`, by session id), and
the plan's settings (start, time zone). `service.progress_view` is a pure function
of the subscription and `now`.

**Rejected.** A stored streak counter, incremented on each report. It drifts: a
report withdrawn, a session moved, a timetable change that renames a session, and
the counter disagrees with the history it claims to summarise. Recomputing is cheap
(a semester is a few hundred sessions) and always agrees with what the student
sees in the calendar.

**Consequence.** A report on a past session, made late, changes the past days it
belongs to. That is intended: it is how a forgotten tap is repaired (D9).

## D9. A streak counts days studied, forgives, and never scolds

**Chosen.** A day is *studied* when at least one session on it was reported done
or hard. A day with nothing planned (a day off, a weekend the plan left free) is
*rest*: it neither extends nor breaks a streak. A day with sessions planned and
none reported is *missed*; the first missed day of each week (Monday to Sunday) is
*forgiven* automatically. Today is never missed before it is over. The streak is the
number of studied days since the last unforgiven miss. The app shows the current
streak, the best one, and what the next session adds ("one session today makes it
5"); it never announces a lost streak.

**Why.** Missing a single day did not materially affect habit formation in Lally et
al. (2010); a broken streak lowers later engagement, more so when people blame
themselves and less when it can be repaired (Silverman and Barasch 2023). Rest days
are part of a good plan, so a planner that breaks streaks on them would punish
following it. Reporting late repairs a day honestly: the student did study.

**Rejected.** *Sessions not reported count as done* (the planner's rule, so a plan
is not derailed by a forgotten tap) is not used for the streak: a streak that grows
with no action measures nothing. *Streak freezes bought with points*: a currency is
a game around the product, and reviewers of Forest show what a currency costs in
goodwill (docs/MARKET.md §4). *Hours as the measure*: rewards long sessions, which
is YPT's failure; the ring fills at the plan's amount and no further.

## D10. Two languages from one catalogue, without a new dependency

**Chosen.** `cps.i18n`: the English sentence is the key; `cps/locales/fr.py` maps
it to French; a missing entry falls back to English. The language of a request is
held in a context variable that the web app sets per request, from the plan's
setting, else a `lang` query parameter (the language links on pages without a
plan), else the browser's `Accept-Language`. No cookie: the footer's promise of
none stays true. Service code calls `_("...")` where it writes a sentence a
student reads, so its functions keep their signatures and stay deterministic in
tests (English unless a test asks). Dates are written by `i18n.format_date` with
the language's own day and month names, never the operating system's locale
(Windows and Linux disagree). A test checks that every `_()` literal in the code
has a French entry. French uses *tu*, as student apps in France do; changing to
*vous* is a catalogue edit. JavaScript strings live in `static/i18n.js`.

**Rejected.** Babel and gettext `.po` files: a dependency and a compile step for two
languages and a few hundred strings. A language parameter threaded through every
service function: hundreds of signature changes for no gain in safety.

**Consequence.** Sentences built in service code before this change are translated
as they are touched; the ones still in English are listed in AUDIT.md item 40.

## D11. Study buddies: invited, few, and shown only what they need

**Chosen.** A student may connect with up to five buddies. Joining takes an invite
code that the inviter shares however they like (a link `/join/<code>` or six
letters read aloud); codes last seven days and serve several people, so one message
to a group works. What a buddy sees, and nothing more: the name the student chose
for buddies, their streak, this week's sessions done out of planned, whether they
studied today, and a "cheer" (once a day per buddy, shown on the receiver's Today
page). Never courses, times, tasks, exams or the calendar. Either side can leave at
any time; deleting a plan, by request or by expiry, deletes its connections and
cheers. Tokens never appear in a buddy's pages: connections have their own ids.

Stored in two new tables of the same SQLite file: `links` (pairs, with the date)
and `invites` (code, inviter, expiry); cheers are rows of `cheers`. `store` stays
ignorant of plans: these are relations between tokens.

**Why.** Accountability to a friend feels supportive and to a stranger evaluative
(docs/MARKET.md §3); no public profile means nothing to moderate and no one to
compare against. The six-letter code is how a student without a link finds a
friend's plan without either of them revealing their secret link.

**Rejected.** Leaderboards by hours (rewards overwork), public profiles and follower
counts (moderation, comparison), sharing courses or timetables (personal data a
friend does not need), a login to find friends (no passwords, D5).

**Consequence.** Joining takes a few taps more than it could: the join page shows
the code and says where to enter it in one's own plan (Progress, then Study
buddies); someone without a plan makes one first and the code comes with them.
Remembering the visitor's plan on the device (a cookie or browser storage) would
save those taps; it was rejected to keep the app free of stored identifiers.

## D12. AI through one provider interface, opt-in, with a hard monthly cap

**Chosen.** `cps.ai` has two features: reading a task typed in words ("stats report
for Friday, about 6 hours") into a name, a due date, hours and a course; and writing
the weekly review's paragraph from its numbers. Each has a rule-based version that
always works (patterns in English and French; a template paragraph) and a model
version used when four things hold: the server has an API key, the student turned
AI on in Settings, the month's spending is under the cap, and the student is under
twenty calls a day. Anything else, including any error, falls back to the rules
without the student noticing more than a plainer result.

The model version calls Anthropic's API through the official SDK (`anthropic`, in
an optional `ai` extra; the core does not import it). The model is a setting,
`CPS_AI_MODEL`, defaulting to Claude Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`, $4 and $20 per
million input and output tokens, Anthropic's price list as cached on 2026-10-06);
Claude Haiku 5.5 (`claude-haiku-5-5`, $0.10 and $0.50) is the cheaper choice the
owner can make. Answers are constrained by a JSON schema (structured outputs), at
low effort, with Anthropic's server-side refusal fallback on. Every call's
tokens and cost are written to an `ai_usage` table; the cap, `CPS_AI_MONTHLY_CAP_USD`
(default 10), is checked against the month's total plus the call's worst case
before each call. The API bills in dollars, so the cap is in dollars.

What is sent: the typed sentence, today's date and weekday, the time zone and the
student's course names; for the review, its numbers and the course and exam names.
Never the token, the timetable, buddies or anything else in the plan.

**Why.** Students already use free AI tutors (ChatGPT's study mode, Gemini's Guided
Learning; docs/MARKET.md §2), so AI here does only what those cannot: put work into
this student's calendar and comment on this student's week. Opt-in, because what a
student types is personal data sent to a processor in the United States; the
privacy page names it.

**Rejected.** AI tutoring or quiz generation (free elsewhere, costly here); AI on by
default (consent first); a provider-neutral HTTP shim (the official SDK handles
retries, timeouts and errors; another provider can implement the same small
interface later); students' own keys (almost none have one).

## D13. The free core is decided now and never shrinks

**Chosen.** Free, always: the plan from a timetable link, the calendar feed, tasks
and deadlines, reports, progress, streaks, the weekly review (rule-written) and
study buddies. Candidates for the paid tier, after the pilot shows people would
pay: AI beyond a monthly allowance, writing directly into Google Calendar (W10),
more than one semester kept. Nothing is gated during the pilot, and no payment code
is written before W12 (docs/ROADMAP.md).

**Why.** Reviewers punish paywalls placed on what used to be free (Forest; docs/
MARKET.md §4). Progress and streaks are the habit; gating them would gate the
reason to return.

## D14. The calendar is the reminder; no push notifications yet

**Chosen.** A session's calendar event, which the student's own calendar app
announces, is the daily trigger, and it already says what to do and links to a
one-tap report. The app adds no notifications of its own in this stage.

**Rejected for now.** Web push (a service worker, keys, a consent prompt, and iOS
support only for installed web apps) and e-mail (an address to collect and a
sender to operate). Revisit after the pilot, with a limit of one a day.

## D15. Engagement is measured from the event log, on the server, without trackers

**Chosen.** The event log (`store.events`) already records setup, reports,
settings and task changes by kind; this stage adds one `visit` event per student per
day a plan's page is opened, which is what "active" means. `service.engagement` counts, for the pilot: students active in
the last 7 and 30 days, the share of planned sessions confirmed, streak lengths,
buddies connected, AI calls and their cost. `cps metrics` prints it. No analytics
script runs in a student's browser (D6).
